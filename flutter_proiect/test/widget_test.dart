// This is a basic Flutter widget test.

// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility that Flutter provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // Enter text and add the item...

    // Swipe the item to dismiss it.
    await tester.drag(find.byType(Dismissible), const Offset(500.0, 0.0));

    // Build the widget until the dismiss animation ends.
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();

    // Ensure that the item is no longer on screen.
